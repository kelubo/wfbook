# DRBD

[TOC]

Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) mirrors block devices  between multiple hosts. The replication is transparent to other  applications on the host systems. Any block device hard disks,  partitions, RAID devices, logical volumes, etc can be mirrored.

To get started using drbd, first install the necessary packages. From a terminal enter:

```
sudo apt install drbd8-utils
```

> **Note**

> If you are using the *virtual kernel* as part of a virtual  machine you will need to manually compile the drbd module. It may be  easier to install the linux-server package inside the virtual machine.

This section covers setting up a drbd to replicate a separate `/srv` partition, with an ext3 filesystem between two hosts. The partition  size is not particularly relevant, but both partitions need to be the  same size.

## Configuration

The two hosts in this example will be called *drbd01* and *drbd02*. They will need to have name resolution configured either through DNS or the `/etc/hosts` file. See [???](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/ubuntu-ha-drbd#dns) for details.

- To configure drbd, on the first host edit `/etc/drbd.conf`:

  ```
  global { usage-count no; }
  common { syncer { rate 100M; } }
  resource r0 {
          protocol C;
          startup {
                  wfc-timeout  15;
                  degr-wfc-timeout 60;
          }
          net {
                  cram-hmac-alg sha1;
                  shared-secret "secret";
          }
          on drbd01 {
                  device /dev/drbd0;
                  disk /dev/sdb1;
                  address 192.168.0.1:7788;
                  meta-disk internal;
          }
          on drbd02 {
                  device /dev/drbd0;
                  disk /dev/sdb1;
                  address 192.168.0.2:7788;
                  meta-disk internal;
          }
  } 
  ```

  > **Note**
  >
  > There are many other options in `/etc/drbd.conf`, but for this example their default values are fine.

- Now copy `/etc/drbd.conf` to the second host:

  ```
  scp /etc/drbd.conf drbd02:~
  ```

- And, on *drbd02* move the file to `/etc`:

  ```
  sudo mv drbd.conf /etc/
  ```

- Now using the drbdadm utility initialize the meta data storage. On each server execute:

  ```
  sudo drbdadm create-md r0
  ```

- Next, on both hosts, start the drbd daemon:

  ```
  sudo systemctl start drbd.service
  ```

- On the *drbd01*, or whichever host you wish to be the primary, enter the following:

  ```
  sudo drbdadm -- --overwrite-data-of-peer primary all
  ```

- After executing the above command, the data will start syncing with the secondary host. To watch the progress, on *drbd02* enter the following:

  ```
  watch -n1 cat /proc/drbd
  ```

  To stop watching the output press *Ctrl+c*.

- Finally, add a filesystem to `/dev/drbd0` and mount it:

  ```
  sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/drbd0
  sudo mount /dev/drbd0 /srv
  ```

## Testing

To test that the data is actually syncing between the hosts copy some files on the *drbd01*, the primary, to `/srv`:

```
sudo cp -r /etc/default /srv
```

Next, unmount `/srv`:

```
sudo umount /srv
```

*Demote* the *primary* server to the *secondary* role:

```
sudo drbdadm secondary r0
```

Now on the *secondary* server *promote* it to the *primary* role:

```
sudo drbdadm primary r0
```

Lastly, mount the partition:

```
sudo mount /dev/drbd0 /srv
```

Using *ls* you should see `/srv/default` copied from the former *primary* host *drbd01*.
