# Transport Encryption



Bareos uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) to provide secure network transport. For data encryption in contrast, please see the [Data Encryption](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/DataEncryption.html#dataencryption) chapter. The initial Bacula encryption implementation has been written by Landon Fuller.

With *Version >= 18.2.4* the TLS code has been enhanced by the TLS-PSK (Pre Shared Keys) feature which allows the daemons to setup an encrypted connection directly  without using certificates. The library used for TLS is openSSL.



## TLS Configuration Directives

Additional configuration directives have been added to all the  daemons (Director, File daemon, and Storage daemon) as well as the  various different Console programs. These directives are defined as  follows:

- [`TLS Enable (Dir->Director)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Director_TlsEnable)

  Enable TLS support. This is by default enabled. If no certificates  are configured PSK (Pre Shared Keys) ciphers will be used. If the other  side does not support TLS, or cleartext is configured the connection  will be aborted. However, for downward compatibility with clients before Bareos-18.2 the daemons can omit transport encryption and cleartext  will be sent.

- [`TLS Require (Dir->Director)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Director_TlsRequire)

  Require TLS connection, for downward compatibility. This is by default disabled. However, if **TlsRequire**=yes, clients with a version before Bareos-18.2 will be denied if configured to use cleartext.

- [`TLS Certificate (Dir->Director)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Director_TlsCertificate)

  The full path and filename of a PEM encoded TLS certificate. It can  be used as either a client or server certificate. It is used because PEM files are base64 encoded and hence ASCII text based rather than binary. They may also contain encrypted information.

- [`TLS Key (Dir->Director)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Director_TlsKey)

  The full path and filename of a PEM encoded TLS private key. It must correspond to the certificate specified in the **TLS Certificate** configuration directive.

- [`TLS Verify Peer (Dir->Director)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Director_TlsVerifyPeer)

  Request and verify the peers certificate. In server context, unless the **TLS Allowed CN** configuration directive is specified, any client certificate signed by a known-CA will be accepted. In client context, the server certificate CommonName attribute is checked against the **Address** and **TLS Allowed CN** configuration directives.

- [`TLS Allowed CN (Dir->Director)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Director_TlsAllowedCn)

  Common name attribute of allowed peer certificates. If **TLS Verify Peer**=yes, all connection request certificates will be checked against this list. This directive may be specified more than once as all parameters will we concatenated.

- [`TLS CA Certificate File (Dir->Director)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Director_TlsCaCertificateFile)

  The full path and filename specifying a PEM encoded TLS CA certificate(s). Multiple certificates are permitted in the file. In a client context, one of **TLS CA Certificate File** or **TLS CA Certificate Dir** is required. In a server context, it is only required if **TLS Verify Peer** is used.

- [`TLS CA Certificate Dir (Dir->Director)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Director_TlsCaCertificateDir)

  Full path to TLS CA certificate directory. In the  current implementation, certificates must be stored PEM encoded with  OpenSSL-compatible hashes, which is the subject name’s hash and an  extension of .0. In a client context, one of **TLS CA Certificate File** or **TLS CA Certificate Dir** is required. In a server context, it is only required if **TLS Verify Peer** is used.

- [`TLS DH File (Dir->Director)`](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/Director.html#config-Dir_Director_TlsDhFile)

  Path to PEM encoded Diffie-Hellman parameter file.  If this directive is specified, DH key exchange will be used for the  ephemeral keying, allowing for forward secrecy of communications. DH key exchange adds an additional level of security because the key used for  encryption/decryption by the server and the client is computed on each  end and thus is never passed over the network if Diffie-Hellman key  exchange is used. Even if DH key exchange is not used, the  encryption/decryption key is always passed encrypted. This directive is  only valid within a server context. To generate the parameter file, you may use openssl: create DH key `openssl dhparam -out dh1024.pem -5 1024 `

## Getting TLS Certificates

To get a trusted certificate (CA or Certificate Authority signed  certificate), you will either need to purchase certificates signed by a  commercial CA or become a CA yourself, and thus you can sign all your  own certificates.

Bareos is known to work well with RSA certificates.

You can use programs like [xca](http://xca.sourceforge.net/) or TinyCA to easily manage your own CA with a Graphical User Interface.

## Example TLS Configuration Files



Examples of the TLS portions of the configuration files are listed below.

## Compatibility with Bareos File Daemon

### Bareos File Daemon connection handshake probing

As from Bareos 18.2 all components by default establish a secure  connection with encryption first, followed by the proprietary Bareos  protocol. This is accomplished using TLS-PSK. Older components of Bareos than version 18.2 start a connection with a cleartext handshake without encryption.

For downward compatibility Bareos Director Daemons and Bareos Storage Daemons are able to connect to Bareos File Daemons older than version  18.2. In this case Director and Storage switch to the old protocol.

There are two connection modes of a File Daemon, active and passive.  In contrast to a connection from an active Bareos File Daemon, the  protocol version of a passive File Daemon has to be probed by the  Director Daemon initially when a job is initiated. This information is  stored in the configuration and immediately submitted to the Storage  Daemon when the job is started.

The following sequence is used to figure out the right protocol  version and to submit this information to the attached Bareos Storage  Daemon:

Sequence diagram of a Bareos File Daemon connection

### Bareos File Daemon 18.2 with Bareos before 18.2

Bareos File Daemon >= 18.2 can be used on a Bareos system before Bareos-18.2.

The *older* Bareos Director and Bareos Storage Daemon connect  to Bareos File Daemon using the cleartext Bareos handshake before they  can switch to TLS. If you want transport encryption then only TLS with  certificates can be used. TLS-PSK is not possible with Bareos Director  and Bareos Storage Daemon before Bareos-18.2.

However, it is also possible to disable transport encryption and use  cleartext transport using the following configuration changes:

#### Bareos Director configuration

```
/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/client/bareos-fd.conf
Client {
  ...
  TlsEnable = no
  TlsRequire = no
  ...
}
/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/storage/bareos-sd.conf
Storage {
  ...
  TlsEnable = no
  TlsRequire = no
  ...
}
```

#### Bareos Storage Daemon configuration

```
/etc/bareos/bareos-sd.d/storage/bareos-sd.conf
Storage {
  ...
  TlsEnable = no
  TlsRequire = no
  ...
}
```

#### Bareos File Daemon configuration

```
/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/client/bareos-fd.conf
Client {
  ...
  TlsEnable = no
  TlsRequire = no
  ...
}
/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/director/bareos-dir.conf
Director {
  ...
  TlsEnable = no
  TlsRequire = no
  ...
}
```

### Bareos File Daemon before 18.2 with Bareos 18.2

Bareos File Daemon *before* 18.2 can be used on a Bareos system 18.2 *onwards*.

The newer Bareos Director and Bareos Storage Daemon connect to Bareos File Daemon using the cleartext Bareos handshake before they switch to  TLS. If you want transport encryption only TLS with certificates can be  used, not PSK as it is possible with Bareos 18.2.

However, it is also possible to disable transport encryption and use  cleartext transport using the following configuration changes:

#### Bareos File Daemon configuration

```
/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/client/bareos-fd.conf
Client {
  ...
  TlsEnable = no
  TlsRequire = no
  ...
}
/etc/bareos/bareos-fd.d/director/bareos-dir.conf
Director {
  ...
  TlsEnable = no
  TlsRequire = no
  ...
}
```



## Bareos Webui

Transport encryption between Bareos Webui and a Bareos Director can be configured on a per restricted named console basis.

TLS-PSK is not available between the Bareos WebUI and the Bareos  Director, in the following you will set up TLS with certificates.

Please check the following configuration examples.  A complete table of the directives in the `directors.ini` file see: [Overview of the settings in the Bareos Webui directors.ini file](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/TransportEncryption.html#directors-ini-directives)

Note

For Bareos Webui the certificate file given by  configuration parameter cert_file in directors.ini has to contain the  certificate and the key in PEM encoding.

## TLS Configuration Reference

To be able to communicate via TLS, TLS needs to be configured on both sides. In Bareos certain directives are used to set up TLS.

The following table explains the location of the relevant TLS  configuration directives for all possible Bareos TCP connections. Each  resource is referred to as <component>-<resource> to  identify the exact configuration location. Refer to chapter [Customizing the Configuration](https://docs.bareos.org/Configuration/CustomizingTheConfiguration.html#configurechapter) for more details about configuration.

In Bareos Version 18.2 the relevant resources for some connections  had to be changed. Affected directives are marked with the applicable  version and the respective resource is written in bold letters.

*Remark: TLS-PSK is not available on Bareos components before Version 18.2.*
